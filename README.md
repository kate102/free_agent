## Your Design Decisions

We'd love to hear your thoughts around any design decisions you made while coding your solution.


## Initial Thoughts
I have a json file with exchange rates from Euro to XXX in date stamped hashes
I have to calculate exchange rates on a given day between 2 currencies
The currencies may not necessarily be to or from Euro
The data may not always come in this format


## Initial Plan
Get RSpec up and running with a dummy test
Test opening the file
Test reading the file & populating some searchable structure (db table ideally but possibly not in a couple of hours)
Test retrieving an exchange rate from Euros
Test retrieving an exchange rate via Euros
Test a missing currency
